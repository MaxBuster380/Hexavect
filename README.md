In this library, you'll find a single class : **HexagonVector**, which can both represent position and movement on the plane.
HexagonVector acts like a **value** rather than an object, meaning an instance never changes.
Note that a hexagon is **not subdividable**, unlike a square or triangle, so all operations are done with integers.

It provides 7 class constants to do operations with :
 - **ORIGIN**, center of the plane.
 - **HOR_RIGHT**, unit vector for moving one tile to the right.
 - **HOR_LEFT**, unit vector for moving one tile to the left.
 - **ASC_RIGHT**, unit vector for moving one tile to the top-right.
 - **ASC_LEFT**, unit vector for moving one tile to the top-left.
 - **DESC_RIGHT**, unit vector for moving one tile to the bottom-right.
 - **DESC_LEFT**, unit vector for moving one tile to the bottom-left.

Instanciating a HexagonVector is the same as getting ORIGIN.
```Kotlin
val a = HexagonVector()

println(a == ORIGIN) // true
```

Operations are done through the standard operators (+ - * /).

```Kotlin
val diagonalTopRight : HexagonVector = HOR_RIGHT + ASC_RIGHT

val diagonalTopRight3Away : HexagonVector = diagonalTopRight * 3
```

Use the `distance` method to measure the distance between two hexagons.
```Kotlin
val a : HexagonVector = HOR_LEFT * 4
val b : HexagonVector = HOR_RIGHT * 5

val distance : Long = a.distance(b)

println(distance) // 9
```

You can translate standard (x, y) coordinates to and from the hexagonal plane. 
```Kotlin
val HEXAGON_RADIUS = 64.0
val mouseX : Int
val mouseY : Int

val selectedTile : HexagonVector = HexagonVector.fromCartesian(mouseX, mouseY, HEXAGON_RADIUS)
val centerSelectedTile : Pair<Double, Double> = selectedTile.toCartesian(HEXAGON_RADIUS)
```
